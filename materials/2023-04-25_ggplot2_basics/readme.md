# Introduction into data visualisation with R & ggplot

In our first workshop we will give you a short introduction into data visualizations in R with ggplot2 from tidyverse. It will be a hands-on workshop with some lecture elements and code snippets you can adapt to your needs. Some prior R knowledge and rough understanding of tidyverse specifics would be helpful but it is not necessary.

**Please download the materials before the workshop**

You need:
* installed R and RStudio
* the R script Code_Intro_R_ggplot2_visuals.R
* the slides Slides_Intro_R_ggplot2_visuals.html - you can only open the slides after you have downloaded them
