# Visualising basic spatial data in R using ggplot

This session gives a minor introduction to plotting with ggplot using the sf-package in R. The presentation slides can be found in this folder along with the accompanying R code to reproduce the examples. To view the presentation.html file, it is easiest to download the whole folder. 

For further, more detailed, information, I recommend visiting and working through the book [ggplot 2: elegant graphics for data analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/)
