# Introduction to Global Fishing Watch Data & R Package

Global Fishing Watch (GFW) seeks to advance ocean governance through increased transparency of human activity at sea. To this end, they create and publicly share map visualizations, data, and analysis tools to enable scientific research and improve fisheries management. As part of this mission, GFW recently shared a new tool - the [`gfwr` R package](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr) - to make it easy for R users to access GFW data on industrial fishing ships worldwide.  

This block has 3 units: 1. Tyler Clavelle from GFW presents the R package and what you could do with the data. 
2. We work with the data ourselves and think about applications / visualizations. 
3. Creating an analysis / visualization.

Tyler Clavelle is a senior data scientist overseeing the evolution of Global Fishing Watch’s core dataset made up of automatic identification system data, 
which helps monitor vessel activity at sea. He works closely with other teams to ensure data is effectively used for analysis and properly incorporated into Global Fishing Watch’s tools. 
Tyler also coordinates the organization’s network of research partners, ensuring they have the knowledge, access and tools needed to produce cutting-edge research with our data. For more GFW R resources, see this blog post by Tyler on [working with GFW data in R](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data/downloadable-public-data-in-r/).
