# Introduction to Global Fishing Watch Data & R Package

Global Fishing Watch makes the data from all fishing ships worldwide publicly available and monitors who is fishing and how much. 
They wrote an R package that you can use to download their data. https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr;

This block has 3 units: 1. Tyler Clavelle from GFW presents the R package and what you could do with the data. 
2. We work with the data ourselves and think about applications / visualizations. 
3. Creating an analysis / visualization.

Tyler Clavelle is a senior data scientist overseeing the evolution of Global Fishing Watch’s core dataset made up of automatic identification system data, 
which helps monitor vessel activity at sea. He works closely with other teams to ensure data is effectively used for analysis and properly incorporated into Global Fishing Watch’s tools. 
Tyler also coordinates the organization’s network of research partners, ensuring they have the knowledge, access and tools needed to produce cutting-edge research with our data.
