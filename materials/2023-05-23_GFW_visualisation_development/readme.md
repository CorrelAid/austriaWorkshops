# Developing visualizations using Global Fishing Watch's Data & R Package

Global Fishing Watch (GFW) seeks to advance ocean governance through increased transparency of human activity at sea. To this end, they create and publicly share map visualizations, data, and analysis tools to enable scientific research and improve fisheries management. As part of this mission, GFW recently shared a new tool - the [`gfwr` R package](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr) - to make it easy for R users to access GFW data on industrial fishing ships worldwide.  

This block has 3 units: 1. Tyler Clavelle from GFW presents the R package and what you could do with the data. 
2. We work with the data ourselves and think about applications / visualizations. 
3. Creating an analysis / visualization.

For this session, we aim to use the data and develop ideas and first steps towards visualizations in R. 
Please fill out the form asking which data you find most interesting for a visualization and about your knowledge of R and ggplot2.

The App.R file in this repo is a template for a shiny app in which we can present the visualizations. In this session, we will discuss what sort of visualizations would be most valuable/interesting while being feasible in the short
amount of time. After deciding this, we will divide the group into 2-4 subgroups which will develop small visualizations using R, the GFW R package and ggplot.
